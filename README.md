# Algorithms Studying

This is my guide of programs for studying for interviews.  I'll implement data structures 
and go thru problems from various books.  These are for studying purposes only and 
should *NOT* be used for cheating on homework.

My goal is to do a breadth-first search thru the problems, answering as many as 
possible then going back thru to optimize when I have time.  With that said, feel 
free to clone or fork, and improve these at will.
